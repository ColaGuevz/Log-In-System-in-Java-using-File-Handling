# Log-In-System-in-Java-using-File-Handling
Using file handling in java, I created a simple log in system. 

***NOTE:***
After running this program, you need to create an account first. In order for the program to run properly, you need to edit the directory of the code in all of the .java file that has a file reader, file writer, file deleter, or/and buffered reader field according to your preference directory in your PC. Also, the graphics of this project sucks, since I'm just a noob. LOL
